# ATM-transaction.py
Made this project to start building my portfolio. I'm at the end of the Codeacademy Computer Science CS101 course. 
Although it says Bank Account within my code, the project is realistically more of an ATM transaction. It's been fun building the project so far, 
learning how to implement classes, objects, and writing methods to do things I want. Its not close to finished yet, so I will update this when I finish.
Grateful for the ride programming has led me as of yet.
